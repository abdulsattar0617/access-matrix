This project, Access Matrix, is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that allows administrators to assign roles to users and manage permissions based on those roles. Although the current version is quite simple, I have developed it in just one day as part of the assignment. In the future, I aim to integrate real-world data to enhance access management. While itâ€™s not fully functional yet, I am confident that with a team, I can improve it significantly and add advanced features.
